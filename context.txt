Kubernetes Deployment Guidelines:

- All production deployments must use Helm charts.
- Containers must run as non-root users.
- Resource limits (CPU and memory) are mandatory for all pods.
- Auto scaling pods must be done using HPA.
- Secrets must be stored using Kubernetes Secrets or an external secrets manager.
- Rolling updates should be used instead of recreating pods by using only dx console.
- Must use an approved CRQ for production deployments.


Failure to follow these guidelines may result in deployment rejection.
